(November 1 2022 ~~Critical~~ High vulnerabilities) tracking

About
-----

This is the GitHub for [the companion spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vT7ih8XJ5LHq-30saNCS9S7pJafe37S1b6ZRxWXcnx6HbrHFFTNIk7-gFQ7_NJlET47w0naS8deLtIG/pubhtml) for fast tracking of information about the November OpenSSL 3 vulnerability.

## Data sets

* [Orgs](data/orgs.md) - companies, vendors, and other orgs, with public signals of potential vulnerability, blog links, KBs, etc
* [OS and Packages](data/os-pkg.md) - tracking of operating systems and package frameworks
* [Products](data/products.md) - individual products, with *both likely and confirmed* OpenSSLv3 status as available - **[NSCS-NL list](https://github.com/NCSC-NL/OpenSSL-2022) rapidly coming more authoritative** - focus your PRs there!

Any strong public signals of products or organizations being affected (or unaffected) are in scope.

Is this undue diligence? Perhaps. But even if this vulnerability is not widely exploitable, I'd "rather have and not need it than need it and not have it". Also, this work is now forward-ready for future vulnerabilities! 😛

## Viewing the data
Because GitHub limits the width of some data, it may be easiest to view [the spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vT7ih8XJ5LHq-30saNCS9S7pJafe37S1b6ZRxWXcnx6HbrHFFTNIk7-gFQ7_NJlET47w0naS8deLtIG/pubhtml).

You can also install the [Stylus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne) and [Widescreen for GitHub](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/widescreen-for-github/elikdceclccjilahimjfceoalhdbndan) Chrome extensions for more real estate.
