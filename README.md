# OpenSSL November 1 2022 vulnerability tracking

About
-----

This is the GitHub for [the companion spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EMGeffxhiRceyz6XW6O6cH5tcrBaoLLX06M9OdNsENY/).

## Contributing

* If you're familiar with git, you can submit updates as PRs.
* Otherwise, you can [open an issue](https://github.com/roycewilliams/openssl-nov-1-critical-cve-2022-tracking/issues/new/choose).

## Data sets

* [Orgs](data/orgs.md) - companies, vendors, and other orgs, with public signals of potential vulnerability, blog links, KBs, etc
* [OS and Packages](data/os-pkg.md) - tracking of operating systems and package frameworks
* [Products](data/orgs.md) - individual products, with *both likely and confirmed* OpenSSLv3 status as available

Because GitHub limits the width of some data, it may be easiest to view [the spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EMGeffxhiRceyz6XW6O6cH5tcrBaoLLX06M9OdNsENY/). You can also install the [Stylus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne) and [Widescreen for GitHub](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/widescreen-for-github/elikdceclccjilahimjfceoalhdbndan) Chrome extensions for more real estate.

## TODO

* Push to GitHub Pages for better display and DataTables filtering
