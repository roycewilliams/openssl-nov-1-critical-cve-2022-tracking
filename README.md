# OpenSSL November 1 2022 vulnerability tracking

About
-----

This is the GitHub for [the companion spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EMGeffxhiRceyz6XW6O6cH5tcrBaoLLX06M9OdNsENY/) for fast tracking of information about the November OpenSSL 3 vulnerability.

Is this undue diligence? Perhaps. But even if this vulnerability is not widely exploitable, I'd "rather have and not need it than need it and not have it". Also, this work is now forward-ready for future vulnerabilities! ðŸ˜›

## Contributing

* If you're familiar with git, you can submit updates as PRs.
* Otherwise, you can [open an issue](https://github.com/roycewilliams/openssl-nov-1-critical-cve-2022-tracking/issues/new/choose) or even (worst case) ping [@TychoTithonus](https://twitter.com/TychoTithonus) on Twitter or [send an email](mailto:storysofare@techsolvency.com?subject=story-so-far%20contrib).

## Data sets

* [Orgs](data/orgs.md) - companies, vendors, and other orgs, with public signals of potential vulnerability, blog links, KBs, etc
* [OS and Packages](data/os-pkg.md) - tracking of operating systems and package frameworks
* [Products](data/products.md) - individual products, with *both likely and confirmed* OpenSSLv3 status as available

Because GitHub limits the width of some data, it may be easiest to view [the spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EMGeffxhiRceyz6XW6O6cH5tcrBaoLLX06M9OdNsENY/).

You can also install the [Stylus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne) and [Widescreen for GitHub](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/widescreen-for-github/elikdceclccjilahimjfceoalhdbndan) Chrome extensions for more real estate.

## TODO

* Push to GitHub Pages for better display and DataTables filtering
